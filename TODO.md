# To Do

- `calcIndividuals` and `calcTeams` do the same, so can be replaced by universal function
- `mapMember` and `mapEvent` do the same, so can be replaced by universal function with a flag
- `MIN_LEN` argument should be optional
- `create(Individuals|Teams|Events)` do almost the same, so could be replaced by universal function
